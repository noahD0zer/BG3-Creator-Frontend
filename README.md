### Overview
BG3 Creator is a character creator and planning tool for my favorite game, Baldurs Gate 3. There are a few wonderful tools out there that accomplish similar goals of character creation, my tool differs in its inclusion of proficiencies and a UI layout that is similar to the in game character creator for the sake of continuity. Proficiencies can be found tied to class, background and race selection. After a character is created, the proficiencies attached to corresponding character values can be foound collected in one list, just as you would see them in game! 

#### Technology Used:
- React
- Bootstrap
- CSS
